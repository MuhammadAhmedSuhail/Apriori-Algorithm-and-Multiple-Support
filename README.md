# Apriori Algorithm and Multiple Minimum Support

## Project Description
This project involves the implementation of the Apriori algorithm in Python from scratch and extending it to handle multiple minimum support thresholds simultaneously. The project also involves the use of data visualization techniques to explore and analyze the frequent itemsets generated by the Apriori implementation. The maximum value for k in both algorithms will be 5.

## Dataset
Two datasets are used for this project:
- Shopping-cart-dataset.csv
- new_customer_supermarket.csv

## Apriori Algorithm Implementation
The Apriori algorithm is implemented in Python from scratch. The implementation consists of two functions:

1. A function to generate all frequent itemsets of size 1 (i.e., all individual items that meet the minimum support threshold). The function also prints pruned and qualified itemsets of size 1.
2. A function to generate all frequent itemsets of size k (where k > 1) using the frequent itemsets of size k-1 and the Apriori property. The function also prints pruned and qualified itemsets of size k.

The Apriori algorithm is then applied to the given dataset. All frequent itemsets are found using minimum support and confidence. Candidates and qualified items at each level are shown, and strong and weak rules are identified with a confidence threshold of 80%.

## Extended Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori implementation is extended to handle multiple minimum support thresholds. The modifications include:

- Modifying the frequent itemset generation functions to accept multiple minimum support thresholds as input.
- Modifying the pruning function to prune itemsets that do not meet any of the minimum support thresholds. The function also prints pruned and qualified itemsets for each minimum support threshold.
- Applying the MIS algorithm to the given dataset. All frequent itemsets are found using minimum support and confidence. Candidates and qualified items at each level are shown, and strong and weak rules are identified with a confidence threshold of 80%. The itemset/combination of itemset removed due to the head itemset problem is also identified.

## GSP Algorithm Implementation
The GSP algorithm is implemented to extract frequent sequential patterns from the list of sequences. The implementation consists of the following:

- Loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe and converting it into a list of sequences. Testing the implementation with the following minimum support counts: 3, 4, and 5.
- Implementing the GSP algorithm to extract frequent sequential patterns from the list of sequences. Printing the items which should pass the minimum support.
- Optimizing the implementation to reduce the number of candidate sequence patterns that need to be examined during the mining process.
- Writing a function named extract_frequent_sequences that takes the list of sequences and a minimum support count as input and returns a list of frequent sequential patterns. The function also prints the infrequent sequential patterns.
